It has come to my attention that some readers of my fine log are saying it contains lies. I have many fact-checkers working for me, and I can tell you for a fact that all the details in these logs are completely accurate. Sometimes I give my honest opinion, which of course is not a fact (though I can understand that some might be mistaken).
Besides that, a certain Tiefling—who shall remain unnamed—has spread the rumour that I do not read every text I am given. That is correct.

### Saving Jonathan and Edmond (+ Stella)
Working with those closely linked to the gods should not be an issue. In any case, I wish [Ash] wouldn’t run off whenever a battle starts. My two other companions, [Lou] and [El], were a bit conflicted about fighting creatures sent by the gods themselves. Of course, we couldn’t let [Jonathan], [Edmond], and [Stella] die because of stupidity, so I suggested we use some old-school persuasion or deception to stop the fighting.
I should not have placed my faith in the lovely brute of a paladin. His “STOP!” sounded more intimidating than anything else—but since he tried to sound friendly, it was neither persuasive nor intimidating. So, we had to fight.

I’m not scared of a fight, though I’d rather avoid one. Since we had a big, strong paladin and a cleric who could heal him if needed, we were fine. I gave my usual support from the sidelines, and once the battle turned in our favour, I stepped in to show some dagger work. Since the creatures were Empyrean Iotas, there was no real killing involved. With no deaths on our side, the intervention was a success!
After the fight, Edmond looked sad and said his favourite son (which is George) had been abducted. If I remember correctly, I accidentally mentioned that he might already be dead—not my best approach, but it was honest. He offered us one hundred gold for finding George (he didn’t specify if George had to be alive) and one group ticket to Avernus.

Basically, to find [Jukura], we first had to find [George]. To find George, we had to find the Bridge to Heaven. And to find the Bridge to Heaven, we had to collect five pieces of George’s diary. I hate scavenger hunts. I have better things to do—and this one might not even bring me closer to my own objective.

Note: George’s birthday is on 1744 Flamerule 22nd.

Some other things we learned: the Celestials didn’t care about the <del>highway</del> elevator to Hell. Another discussion we should have is whether we should use the <del>stairway</del> Bridge to Heaven if we find it, or use it as leverage. I’m in favour of using it—I want to see the heavens with my own eyes. El is opposed. Lou sides with El, and Ash hasn’t voted yet.

Side quest unlocked: Get El a unicorn.

### George's Observatory
We were transported to a large mansion via carriage (together with Edmond and Jonathan). There, we were brought to George’s workroom. It was more of an observatory with a big glass dome. We saw a telescope, and Lou tried to use it—he said he saw stars, but since it was raining, that’s impossible, I tell you!

Next to that, George had three clocks without arms. Either the man is clumsy, or it’s a puzzle. We also found a piece of his diary, which according to El said that George was in love with a construct.

#### The puzzle with the 3 clocks
To get to the secret underground room, we needed to solve a puzzle. It was clear that George didn’t want anyone finding his secret, and my companions were unwilling to brute-force the code. In the end, entering numbers at random might have saved us some time, but not much.

The clocks were marked with colours, but for this example, I’ll use numbers. So we had clocks 1, 2, and 3. On a separate note, we found the following:

1. 10+2+2+6+8
2. 6+6+9+6
3. 6+2+6+10+10+6+2

After some thought, it became clear that the correct answer was 248. A door opened, and we could continue.

Question for when we find George: Why use a three-digit number for a lock? This can be brute-forced within an hour. And why write it down like this? Do you want Celestials to find your secret? He really needs better security.

### The Dark Room Below
Lou took a skull from the observatory and gave it light for me to use. The gentle paladin proves to be very versatile indeed. He also learned from his past mistake by giving me his sword. This time, however, we weren’t attacked.

We followed a long and dark corridor until we came across a split. I decided to go left, and El suggested right. Lou went with El, so I told him to turn around and point to the right (which was my left). So we went left.

We stumbled upon a dead end with a locked manhole. With no effort, I managed to open it and wisely had Lou go first. It seemed to be just an exit, but at least we knew that now. So we went back and took the other side.

At that point, we found a door. Nothing special. Lou contemplated knocking, but I took the initiative and stepped forward. My heart stopped for a moment when I realised I’d forgotten to check for traps—I almost triggered the tripwire in front of the door. I disarmed it and then knocked twice.

Inside, we found the construct named [Andrea]. This was George’s actual workroom, which looked quite nice. We were greeted by Andrea, and I noted that El knew a secret word (though I can’t remember why I wrote that down). We also learned that George had seven trusted colleagues—one named [Felwin]. They’re using secret tunnels like this one, so that’s another mystery to solve.

#### Jonathan is a Cambian (?)
It is my belief at this point that Jonathan might be a Cambion. We found another piece of the diary in which George mentioned “his own kind.” Since Jonathan is an adopted son, it’s plausible. And let’s not forget that Cambions tend to look human in our plane (as El told me—she read it in a newspaper).

### The Final Secret Note
This one was easy. We had a translation page and some secret glyphs. George and his allies really need to improve their security if they ever hope to outsmart the Celestials.

Hopefully Ash can make sense of this. My thought is that the Orb is the bridge.
