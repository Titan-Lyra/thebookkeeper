While writing this, I’m struck by how much I miss [Caelum], my former #1 of the short-lived Team 14. I had been looking forward to recording more of his foolishness, but alas—he remains fast asleep beside his newly hatched pet dragon. Thankfully, [Grof] managed to pack enough heroism into a single day to keep this log lively nonetheless.

## Arriving in Hubbleton
In a small town, seven days’ march from Greyhawk (if you travel at the pace of the Nyrond soldiers), lies Hubbleton. Just over the border of the Duchy of Urnst. Still a long way from Nyrond, and even further from Rel Mord, the capital itself. To a future reader, this may seem like nothing more than the first chapter of many unfortunate events. And you’d be right.

The soldiers immediately took possession of the homes, demanding shelter for the night. It was no friendly request. As they dragged the unconscious prince into one of the buildings, a young soldier with a fair face and golden hair began mingling with the party. [Grof] wasted no time taking an interest in her—[Katrin River] was her name. She, in turn, seemed struck by him as well; perhaps she had seen him spar with the Nyrond soldiers during the journey.

“Fire!” a townsfolk cried. Former Team 14 rushed toward a confectionery already engulfed in flames. Had they still been under my guidance, I would have sent shy [Alice] to rally the townsfolk into a bucket brigade. Unfortunately, she thought she knew better and tried to handle it all herself. [Amber], ever the loner, didn’t think of it either.
Then came a voice from within, crackling against the roar of the blaze: Help. It was enough for a broad red orc to charge forward. He broke down the back door, stormed inside, leapt the counter, and emerged through the front—carrying none other than the beloved confectioner, [Edith Applegarth]. The crowd erupted with cheers as the newcomer, who had barely arrived in Hubbleton, carried her to safety.

Sadly, the others did not manage to quench the fire.

## Investigating the Fire
As the Nyrond soldiers under command of Lord Commander [Leeroy Smart] and Prince [Caleb] didn’t seem to care about the incident, the four—plus the lovely Katrin—decided to investigate the fire. While gathering clues they found a Burnt Roll, which they later discovered came from the bakery of one [Fill Flourforge]. Curiously, the roll had been eaten by a non-human creature. Inside the house [Rowan] found a family portrait: a young Edith with a young boy. That boy was none other than her brother Asger, who had disappeared into the woods and never returned.

After some more questioning the party had two leads. Edith, reluctantly, named Fill as a possible suspect. On the other hand, a drunken woman claimed she had seen a golden creature flying past the building. To save time they could have split to cover more ground, but somehow they decided to stay together.

Since Fill’s bakery was closer, they went there first. They asked almost no questions. Rowan bought a dozen cinnamon rolls, Amber a loaf of sweet bread, and Grof was persuaded to buy an entire loaf of bread. Once outside, the two lovebirds—Grof and Katrin—had a lovely conversation, while Amber and Alice looked on full of jealousy. Rowan eventually decided to try his luck again with Fill, but hopelessly failed to get any more information. So, after a brief pause, they entered the woods to the north.

While marching in the woods, Grof suddenly heard the sound of coins falling from his pouch. A small critter was holding one of the coins and rushed into the trees. Rowan decided to have a stern talk with the creature. The creature, however, had the upper hand as he managed to use persuasion on the druid himself. He received one cinnamon roll. However, the squirrel wanted more and demanded one of his now domesticated humans, whom he named “Rody.” After many bites, the critter—who was now called “Nibbles”—decided that his memory was clear enough to point them in the direction of the fire-breathing dragon.

## The Candy Cottage
After walking for an hour, they discovered a cottage made entirely of candy. If I had seen this building, it would have taken all my effort to resist the temptation. I would have devoured the entire house. It was decorated with lollipops, taffy, truffles, and other bite-size delights. The windows were made of colourful sheets of sugar glass, and there was so much more. While writing this, I find myself wishing I could return for a taste.

Grof checked the building and saw no soul. He carefully wiped his feet, as instructed by the doormat. As they entered the hallway, an unfortunate event occurred: a 5-foot-long, 10-foot-wide wooden rolling pin fell from the ceiling and rolled toward the intruders. Grof, Amber, Katrin, and Nibbles luckily managed to jump over it. Rowan and Alice, however, were crushed and did not survive. The sound of their bodies being flattened was horrendous.

Let me remind you: this would not have happened if they had stayed with me in Greyhawk. They were adults and could make their own decisions. We should not dwell on the mistakes they made in recent times. But it was a long time coming. Had they gone straight back to me after Streaming Springs, they would still be alive. Let’s not linger too long on them—their story has been told.

After the two were crushed, they were greeted by two strange candy creatures. As they had no names, I decided to call one Celia and the other Arwon. Nibbles immediately took a liking to Arwon as he tried to eat him. Since Arwon didn’t appreciate this, the critter moved to Amber’s shoulder. She probably didn’t mind, but had to keep appearances, so she pretended to dislike it.

Inside the house, the group discovered a giant doll named [Bubba Wugga], who was guarding the kitchen door. At this point, they decided to split up. Arwon went to a playroom full of toys, where he found a gray Bag of Tricks. Grof and Katrin encountered three Bugbears in a Taffy Factory, while Celia and Amber went straight through the Apple Orchard to the Chocatrice Barn. The rogue and the candy creature were immediately attacked by flying chocolate birds. Celia almost got eaten alive (if she is actually alive and not just animated). But thanks to Grof’s swift intervention, the day was saved—for now.

At that moment, Caelum knocked on the door, having heard his friends from within.
