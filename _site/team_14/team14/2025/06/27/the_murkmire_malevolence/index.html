<h3 id="rise-team-14">Rise team 14</h3>
<p><em>15th of Ches, 1493DR</em></p>

<p>Today I assembled a new team (team 14) to replace team 11. A group of random loners. A prince who will never sit on his father’s throne, a rogue with no family name (yet) who was forced to live in the shadows (but was not hard to find), a druid, a barbarian, and… should they get bored, a bard to entertain them. I estimate their chances of success at 23%. Tomorrow I will meet them.</p>

<h3 id="the-stone-that-is-an-egg">The stone that is an egg</h3>
<p><em>16th of Ches, 1493DR[I]</em></p>

<p>A doctor at Varkenbluff University in Greyhawk has approached me. Like many who are desperate, she offered me gold to help her. Her story intrigued me. A stone that is not a stone but an egg — that reminds me of one of the members of team 14, but I digress… The doctor claims it is the egg of an eldritch horror. If it hatches, it could have dire consequences, and time is of the essence. Since urgency is required, I fear there is no choice but to assign team 14 to the task. Well, if we do nothing, the outcome may be worse… I hope.</p>

<h3 id="a-somwhat-not-horrible-first-meeting">A somwhat not horrible first meeting</h3>
<p><em>16th of Ches, 1493DR[II]</em></p>

<p>My loyal assistant #237 (rest in peace #236) has brought team 14 to me. It felt awkward, as if some of them had never been part of a group before. I am starting to have doubts about this group’s chances of success. <a href="./grof_granok.md">#4</a> is a typical barbarian who prefers fighting over careful strategies. <a href="./alice.md">#5</a> is not a bard as you would expect. No eye contact whatsoever. <a href="./caelum.md">#1</a> carries a purple glowing stone, which he believes is well hidden. <a href="./rowan.md">#3</a> showed his discomfort—whether this was due to the group or because he cannot cope with the bustle of the city I have yet to discover. <a href="./amber.md">#2</a> has piqued my interest. Usually, I can quickly uncover a contractor’s background, but with this halfling I have not succeeded so far.</p>

<p>I have instructed them to speak with Doctor Darnell. #237 will bring them to her. To be sure, I am sending [redacted] along to keep an eye on them.</p>
