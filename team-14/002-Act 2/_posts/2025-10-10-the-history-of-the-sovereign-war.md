Well… the hero of this story is dead. It’s over. No more tales to tell. I, the Book Keeper—once known as Derek—am dead. It was bound to happen eventually; I’ve died many times before. But this soon? That, I hadn’t expected.

### Before anyone asks…
I told Team 14 the truth: I wouldn’t have saved them if it hadn’t been for [Amber] and [Grof]. Amber’s mother would have killed me herself (and thus died as well) if she’d found out I let her daughter perish. And Grof—well, Grof is Grof. He might one day grow strong enough to do great things. But I must admit, he’ll never match his late uncle Urc. Those are large boots to fill.

You may have noticed I never cared much for [Caelum]. I never wished him dead—and I still don’t. But I must confess (and death came too soon for me to do so in life) that my feelings about his father clouded my judgment. So there’s that.

[Rowan] was… fine, I suppose. Nothing more, nothing less. At least he tried to be a traditional hero. Unfortunately, traditional heroism is not enough when facing the enemy they faced. In that regard, he fell short. Still, he was the only one smart enough to flee and get help—and if he hadn’t, they’d all be dead by now.

My dear [Rose]… she was like a daughter to me. Never a true team player—the others didn’t even know she was part of the team. That was for the best; her involvement would have increased their chances of success, and I needed to know if the others were capable on their own. Sadly, her relentless pursuit of her father’s legacy may yet destroy her.

And let’s not forget [Alice].

### The Sovereign War
It has been more than twenty years since the final clash between the forces of light and the being known as the Overking—the battle fought at the border of the kingdom, where the fate of our world was decided.
Back then, I was [Derek]: a bard who could change his face and name as easily as a melody. I travelled with two halflings. [Arielle], the cleric who could heal any wound, and [Tevon], the ranger who never missed his mark. Together, we crossed the lands, righting wrongs and saving those in need.

Along the way we met [Urg] Gra’nok, a handsome red-skinned orc. He was strong, clever (though he spoke with no more than two vowels at a time), and kind. Later, Prince [Dustan] of Nyrond joined us—a skilled fighter and a loyal friend. For five years we journeyed together, doing what heroes do.

I remember the day Amber was born—the joy in her parents’ eyes as they held her for the first time. We were ready to retire, to live quiet lives. Dustan even offered us a place in his kingdom. Urg, however, could never set down his sword. We said our goodbyes.

It wasn’t long before the red orc returned, bringing grave news: the Overking’s army was marching toward the border. I begged them all to stay behind—Arielle and Tevon had a child now, Dustan had two heirs of his own—but they refused. They would fight.

And so we did. With a small elite force gathered by Dustan, we faced the Overking and his hordes head-on. We won that first battle… but we could never have imagined what came next.

The Overking gathered six newborns and infused them with fragments of his essence. “My children,” he called them. As long as his children lived, he could not die. My task was to destroy those essences—but I did not know they were infants. I stood there, dagger in hand, one baby in my arms, paralyzed by the choice.

At that same moment, Dustan retreated. He abandoned us. His army withdrew, and he vanished. I curse him to this day. Urg called my name, but I couldn’t move. By the time I did, it was too late. He saved my life and he died.

I remember little after that. The enemy seized five of the infants, but somehow I escaped with the one I held. I left her in the woods. I don’t know what I hoped for—that she’d be eaten by wolves, or found and loved by strangers? Either fate might have been kinder. I should have ended her life then and there.

The Overking could not be slain. The world would fall unless we found another way. A dark wizard offered us one: a ritual to seal him and his kingdom away. It required a sacrifice—one of us had to carry the seal to him, binding him to another plane, while the rest of us maintained the prison for the rest of our days.

By then, Dustan had returned—his father slain, his crown newly claimed. King Dustan I, he called himself.

We agreed to draw straws to decide who would sacrifice themselves. Tevon and I both insisted Arielle stay with Amber. But when I awoke, I found his letter:

> “I’m sorry. I know this wasn’t the plan, but as a father, I must protect my daughter from all evil. Take care of Amber and Arielle. Thank you for the adventure.
> —Tevon.”

I ran outside, but it was too late. The artifact already blazed with light. Tevon had reached the Overking. His death would mean nothing unless we joined the ritual. So we did. Arielle’s heart broke, but she was proud.

The Overking and his entire kingdom vanished—sealed into another plane. Dustan, Arielle, and I were left to hold the barrier, waiting for the day a new generation of heroes would rise to finish what we could not.
