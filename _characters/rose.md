Per her request I call her [redacted] in my logs. To me she is #0 of team 14. Rose has been one of the best - although I should say that there is no one better - fixer in Greyhawk. If you need your records to be wiped, just go to Rose, pay her a descent sum and no one knows you every excisted. She knows there is one record you can’t erase—and if you’re reading this, you know exactly what I mean. 

I met her in the streets of Greyhawk. As a collector of information, someone who does the opposite is very intreging to me. After some persuasion we made a deal. She would give me information before deletion and in exchange I would let her work for me. Our professional relationship has been a fruitful one for more than ten years. Thanks to that relationship I also met her father [Lysander](../lysander).
