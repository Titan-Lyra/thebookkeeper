<p>From my own intel, I understand that Caelum was trained for the battlefield. Presumably, his dream is to become Lord Commander one day. He has accepted that he shall never be a king. That has been reserved for his older brother. In my honest opinion, Caelum is the lucky one. Most kingâ€™s are fools and only a fool wants to be a king.</p>

<p>There was a time when it was believed that he had perished in the wilderness. Nevertheless, I met him on the 16th of Ches, 1493DR. He tried to hide it, but he carries a purple glowing stone with him. Normally, I would not waste my time on trinkets, but something tells me there is more to this stone than meets the eye.</p>
