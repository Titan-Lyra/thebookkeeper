**Species:** Aasimar  
**Class:** Bard  

Note to self: never ever forget to verify your intel. Alice Lunara was supposed to be a brilliant performer. During our first meeting she was nothing more than a shy Aasimar girl. Every question I asked I didn't get a proper response. Interesting. As a fellow Bard I would have expected more, but as those who have known me for a long time know, I have high expections of those who are a bard. Hopefully she will suprise me. Otherwise I will have to find another bard (or I'll give an instrument to the orc, that might be fun).

Somehow my intel refer back to [Lysander](characters/lysander). I thought the old man (don't tell him I call him that) to be dead. Why did he take an interest in this odd-looking Aasimar (note: all Aasimar's are odd-looking)? I think it will be time for me to locate Lysander and ask him some questions.
