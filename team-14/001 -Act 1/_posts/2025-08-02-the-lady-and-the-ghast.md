I want to start with distancing myself from Team 14. I do not condone the murder of any sentient creatures. Rest in pieces Harry the magical door.

Introducing #1 to the group has been a big mistake from the beginning. Every issue this group has encountered was in my belief his doing. It is my belief that he drinks alcohol on the job. This time an innoncent bystander (I don't care that it was a sentient door) perished by his hand. At this point I think the success in the Greyhawk Museum was due to mere luck and not skill. Although someone like #2 and #3 might have contributed to their achievement. #4 is a beautiful orc. He doesn't bother other people (like a certain Cleric) with endless questions. When he has to wait he starts woodworking. Every incident he was involved in was triggered by mister his royal highness. So we can't blame the babarian.

Unfortunately my information is sparse for this adventure. If my information is correct they have met with [Lord Cedric Halveron] and [Lady Ameline Halveron], although the latter was under less than ideal circumstances. Also, they had a few converstations with the personal guard of the lord named [Dillan Lyvel] and the personal guard of the lady [Randall Ashtar]. Since I cannot verify all facts I have written down a fairy tale based on information I have managed to gather.

### The Lady and the Ghast

![The Lady and the Ghast]({{"/team-14/images/the-lady-and-the-ghast.png" | relative_url}})

Once upon a time, in a town not far from here,<br>
There dwelled a ghast who spread his fear.<br>
[The lady]({{ '/characters/ameline-halveron/' | relative_url }}) trembled and begged for aid,<br>
And so came five adventurers, eager to be paid.

Upon arrival, the lord said, “There is no concern.”<br>
And ordered the adventurers at once to return.<br>
But one was [the prince]({{ '/characters/caelum/' | relative_url }}) from a kingdom close by,<br>
So [the lord]({{ '/characters/cedric-halveron/' | relative_url }}) gave them a room beneath his high sky.

The lady was hidden safely in the cellar,<br>
So a [cleric]({{ '/characters/ties-van-inkt/' | relative_url }}) performed a tale most stellar.<br>
The guards abandoned the hall at their post,<br>
As the heroes crept in, seeking a ghost.

But alas, they found nothing in that lonely hall,<br>
And thought their grand adventure small.<br>
Yet the [druid]({{ '/characters/rowan/' | relative_url }}) had seen through spider’s eyes,<br>
And whispered of where they might claim their prize.

The torches were lit, and Harry the door appeared,<br>
Soon he would face the ones he feared.<br>
No one could enter, that was his decree,<br>
Unless the lord himself granted them key.

The [orc]({{ '/characters/grof-granok/' | relative_url }}) did not understand what was said,<br>
So he did the thing the door would dread.<br>
While Harry pleaded, the ram struck fast—<br>
One final slam, and the doorway was past.

With no remorse they entered the prison,<br>
Not knowing the dead had already risen.<br>
The [rogue]({{ '/characters/amber/' | relative_url }}) crept with a silent grace,<br>
Unaware of the horrors she’d soon face.

They met the ghouls without despair,<br>
For they had brought the tools to bear.<br>
One door remained, looming and tall,<br>
Behind it waited the worst of all.

A ghast appeared in the lady’s dress,<br>
And the heroes sensed a dark distress.<br>
A dreadful secret then was laid,<br>
And for their knowledge, a price was paid.

The lord confessed, his voice in pain,<br>
Why his poor lady must remain in chain.<br>
“Without the curse she would surely die,”<br>
He whispered through tears with a mournful sigh.

The five brave souls then swore a vow,<br>
To find the cure, though they knew not how.<br>
A promise was spoken, steadfast and true,<br>
The cleric remained, for his task was due.

The lady, alas, could not be saved,<br>
For by night her hunger raged and craved.<br>
And although Team 14 was sent.<br>
The adventure did not end.

### The adventure will continue
#6 (hereby declared the official 7th member of Team 14), Ties van Inkt, chose to remain in Streaming Springs to aid Lady Ameline. The other four adventurers set out for Greyhawk to seek answers about the curse. Before their departure, the lord informed them he had purchased a potion at great expense from a young woman, but shared no further details. The group was given a total of 100 gold coins to split among themselves. It remains unclear whether #6 has received his share.

#3 also has found an old letter in one of the prison cells. It took me a while to see it with my own eyes.

![Old letter]({{"/team-14/images/old_letter.jpeg" | relative_url}})

> To my dearest **Elira**,
> 
> If these words should ever reach your hands, I have long since vanished, and this fortress has become my tomb. The walls whisper with voices that belong to no living soul, and the shadowed footsteps of my fallen men haunt me in every corridor.
> 
> The **Compass of Lost Paths** still rests here, abandoned where I could no longer bear its weight: **hidden in the old watchtower, beneath the cracked sundial where once the light guided our ships to the harbor**. The wizard who gifted it to me claimed it could turn fate but once, as if the world itself would redraw its path for the one who holds it.
> 
> Should anyone read this, be warned: the road to salvation does not lie here. **Seek Captain Sareth in the harbor of Grimharbor**—or whatever remains of it in your time. He alone knew the true nature of this relic, and his word shall guide you where my steps have failed.
> 
> May whoever finds this live where I have died,  
> and may the sea winds whisper your name as once they carried mine.
> 
> In eternal devotion,  
> **Captain Rorik Veylan**


### While the others were enjoying themselves...
[Alice]({{ '/characters/alice/' | relative_url }}) and I attended a garden party in the High Quarter. It was amusing to see her so shy among all the royals and nobles. Still, I believe it was a valuable experience for her—and, if I’m honest, she was meant to be my distraction from the upper crust. Or so I had hoped.

Within the hour, I lost track of her. I’d introduced her to Crown Prince Caleb of Nyrond (yes, Caelum’s brother—and every bit as smug), and after that, she vanished for most of the evening. It wasn’t until five hours later that I saw her again. Her silvery skin now bore a faint shade of red. I didn’t dare ask what had happened behind closed doors.
