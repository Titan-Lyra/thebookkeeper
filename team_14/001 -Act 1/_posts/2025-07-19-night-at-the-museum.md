“The city guard of the Free City of Greyhawk is seeking five individuals for theft, assault and attempted murder.” Reading the newspaper is one way to discover what your team has been up to. According to those reports, Team 14 has stolen far more than the Murkmire Stone. They are said to have entered the building by two routes: the loading dock and the roof. The gang allegedly made off with fortunes from the Greyhawk Museum, forcing its indefinite closure. Curator [Alda Arkin] has stated she was devastated by the theft and that her life’s work has been ruined. Some of the purloined artefacts had been loaned to the museum by other institutions.

Taken at face value, this would be alarming. After all, Team 14 was commissioned to retrieve a single stone—an egg about to hatch, which would have unleashed an eldritch horror. The potential consequences were not only assault but the deaths of many guards and the disappearance of that stone. Eventually, the beast would have escaped to wreak havoc across the city. Thus, I am not troubled by the reports of guards being attacked, which was necessary to achieve their objective. The theft of the Murkmire Stone was carried out for the greater good. The other claims are, of course, largely unfounded. I prefer to set the record straight: this mission was undertaken in honour.

### Outside
As I observed [#1]({{ '/characters/caelum/' | relative_url }}) and [#4]({{ '/characters/grof-granok/' | relative_url }}) from afar, I noticed them deep in conversation with one “Captain” Frankheim Walters—an influential noble more inclined to purchase honours than earn them. No doubt #1 looked up to him; I had pity for #4, forced to endure such sycophancy. I still wonder why [redacted] insisted I add #1 to Team 14.

When their protracted discussion at last concluded, they made their way to the museum’s loading dock. True to form, [#2]({{ '/characters/amber/' | relative_url }}) expertly lowered a rope for her companions below; any competent thief would simply have climbed it. With the group below refusing to climb, the party’s better half on the roof was forced to send a note down with instructions. [#3]({{ '/characters/rowan/' | relative_url }}) was shrewd enough to omit his name—but, unsurprisingly, #1 not only signed his own name, but #4’s as well. Pro tip: never leave incriminating evidence.

Rather than ascend the rope himself, #1 decided to open the loading dock doors—a manoeuvre that produced a deafening clang audible from my vantage point on the far side of the building. The barbarian (#4) countered his boredom by hurling rocks against a metal fence. Who can blame him? By then, the guards were on full alert—spotting the rope and hearing the noise, they naturally assumed intruders had reached the roof.

### Guards on Alert
This is where things became chaotic, and even my own intelligence failed to capture every detail. The druid incapacitated the first guard who entered the roof through the skylight with just two blows. Another guard who re-entered the building was likewise quickly subdued—until two more guards emerged from the stairwell and surprised them.

I remain puzzled as to why [Violet Pendergilt] offered no resistance. Although #2 spoke to her briefly, they still had to render her unconscious. I should have sought clarification; once Team 14 makes for Still Waters, I may pay Violet a visit myself.

A further clash occurred in the Gemstone Wing and the Underground Wonder exhibit, nearly costing both #3 and [#5]({{ '/characters/alice/' | relative_url }}) their lives. Given my plans with the bard, their potential deaths would have been most regrettable; I am relieved to report that both survived the scuffle. It was also amply demonstrated that Alice is anything but boring, which worked against her when she tried to put two guards to sleep.

One troubling—and as yet unverified—incident involved the prince (yet again). Although the team had agreed not to kill any guards, he apparently believed those rules did not apply to him. He struck three guards to the brink of death. The barbarian, stirred by rage (and perhaps by royal example), then knocked out a surrendering guard.
 
### Retrieving the Murkmire Stone
Surprisingly, this part went rather well. They seized the fake Murkmire Stone; the prince successfully broke open the encasement with some finesse (credit where credit is due) and masterfully swapped the egg for the stone. It was rather interesting that it took Alda Arkin only five seconds to realise the real stone had been replaced with a counterfeit.

They then promptly departed the museum by descending the rope. I’d rather not mention that the orc proved mischievous and absconded with an axe and a dagger—so, yes, one of them committed theft. Moreover, the guard, [Garent Millaneff] asserts that 200 gold pieces were stolen from him.

### Mission Accomplished
[Dannell] retrieved the egg, allowing the Free City of Greyhawk to rest—at least for now. #1 nearly perished when it was discovered that he is soul-linked to his purple dragon egg (I now suspect every “stone” may be an egg in disguise). So, if you wish to kill him, merely deprive him of his egg—though that’s a jest; I cannot abide him, but I do not wish him dead.

As an additional reward, I presented them with a Wand of Magic Detection, which the druid accepted with grace.

Their next destination is Still Waters, where the team will investigate the appearance and disappearance of a ghast. There they will collaborate with a librarian named [Ties], hereby dubbed #6. They are instructed to meet discreetly with [Lady Ameline Halveron] without her husband, [Lord Cedric Halveron], becoming aware of their conversation.
