With the battle inside won, we weren’t in the clear just yet. Of course, I looked like one of the cultists, so I could use that to our advantage. To be safe, I recommended that [Devon] change into the attire of the other cultist. It was clear my group had a taste for blood, as they wanted to dive headfirst into combat with the cultists outside. At this moment, we didn’t know who we were dealing with—or how many there were.

### Preparing
[Madam Spider] gave each of us one special bean, which practically served as a full night’s rest (although it would not heal any injuries you had sustained). Conveniently, she had exactly five—one for each of us. I decided to keep mine for now. Some might say that’s foolish, but I say it’s foolish to use such a potent resource so early in an adventure. [Chronos] had already shown his true colours when he demanded more beans. Madam Spider insisted she only had five. I do wonder… if we had been six, would she have had six beans? But that would make no sense. Right?

### Outside
Sneaking out through the side door, I spotted three cultists standing in a circle, performing some kind of ritual. A little further away were three more, wearing the same robes I wore. One of them looked like the leader, so I knew he was the one I needed to speak to.
The five other students—[Javenesh Stoutdaw], [Larine Arneza], [Melwythorne], [Mina Lee], and [Quentillius Angiphiun Melentor III]—were locked inside a magical cage along with [Kevin Lee] and [Sarah Lee]. We were somewhat outnumbered, but if we could unlock the cage and take out a few cultists, the battle might be manageable. Unless, of course, the three at the circle successfully summoned a hellspawn… but what are the chances?

#### Derek’s brilliant plan that is totally not improvised
Part one of this plan was to impersonate a cultist. Easy—if I’d had time to prepare. Unfortunately, time was not on our side, so I had to rely on good old-fashioned improvisation. My goal was simple: make them run. “We have to run—the deans are on their way!” Normally, that would have worked perfectly. Unfortunately, that was exactly what the cultists wanted. When the captain asked, “What’s the code word?” I didn’t answer—answering is for amateurs. Instead, I deflected: “We have no time for this! Why are you discussing this while we have bigger issues?” This trick always works… except when it doesn’t.

So, I moved to part two. I learned that their goal was simply to cause chaos. On my suggestion, the captain dismissed the two cultists who weren’t in the ritual circle. I urged the last cultist to follow me inside so we could “lock up” the captives we had. Once inside, I put my dagger to his throat. I got a few answers before realising we were running out of time—we had to stop the ritual outside. We tied the cultist up to deal with later.

Thankfully, a monk named [RyzeFoYu], acting on his own, managed to unlock the cage. Unfortunately, he should have focused on the summoning circle—because it went up in flames, and a hellspawn appeared, surrounded by hellfire where the cultists had stood. How lovely.

### The battle with the Hellspawn
You would think Chronos would know that throwing a fireball at a hellspawn is useless. Nevertheless, the “brilliant” wizard tried—and failed—since the fire was simply absorbed. Early in the fight, Devon was injured, and I had to save her—though I took a few hits myself in the process.

The two cultists the captain had sent away returned, now accompanied by a Hell Hound. Great. (Yes, I’m being sarcastic.) I tried—and failed—to send them away again. The Hell Hound attacked me, but my quick reflexes saved my life.

With some effort, we managed to banish the hellspawn back to Avernus. The two cultists, however, perished. Fortunately, we still had the one tied up inside for questioning.

### Not much information
If I want to be intimidating, I can be very intimidating. I grabbed the cultist by the neck and dragged him outside. “Look who you’re dealing with,” I said in my most threatening voice. “My friends here still have a taste for blood. I don’t think we need more bloodshed—but we do need more information.”

To add urgency, I struck a deal with the monk: he could kick the cultist if I raised my hands. I believe he was allowed five kicks.

Here’s what we learned:

- The code word is “Tree Trunk.” Why? No idea.
- His code name was [Falcon].
- They’d been preparing this attack for months.
- There is a secret leader.

Falcon, still bound, would be sent to the Strixhaven faculty for… further discussions. We could have returned to Strixhaven Commons, but since we didn’t know what dangers lay ahead, resting at the Shady Spider seemed wiser. After a good rest, we were met by Deans [Lisette] and [Valentin] from Witherbloom—along with a few guards.
