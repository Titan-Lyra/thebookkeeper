Why did she want to speak with [Amber] alone? This is the question I still have. If the team needed her, it was at this moment. Nevertheless, I am glad no prince got hurt.  

## Two Brothers
As we—that is [Caleb], [#5]({{ '/characters/alice/' | relative_url }}), and yours truly—waited for the arrival of Team 14, I was trying to write some fiction in the back. And I know you might wonder why I would spend my precious unlimited time on such an endeavour, but sometimes you need to get your mind off things. In my case, this was to ignore the conversation between those two in front of me. #5 and that crown prince were getting on my nerves somehow.  

Sure enough, the party arrived with two fewer members than I expected. Luckily for me, [#6]({{ '/characters/ties-van-inkt/' | relative_url }}) stayed in Streaming Springs. For a moment, I had this strange anxious feeling when Amber was not present with the rest of the group. I tried to cope with the idea that she rightfully saw she had more potential elsewhere. This was not the case. I am not sure if I should say “unfortunately” or “luckily.”  

After adventuring for three months, [Caelum]’s time came to an end. Well—almost. He has three days before he departs back to Nyrond, where he can bother other people within the safety of his daddy.  

## Rose
Amber was wise enough to inform the others of Rose. If anyone knows anything going on in Greyhawk, it is her. Sadly, she forgot to warn them to stay clear of a certain Bubbles. But what were the chances they would run into that individual, right?  

[Rose] was working in the Black Dragon Inn, meeting with Captain [Harlan Drenn] of the City Guard. #5 needs to learn some manners, as she apparently rudely interrupted their conversation. *“I put the little lamb in her place,”* was what she told me afterwards. They should have been grateful she kept her mouth shut about their activities in the Greyhawk Museum. The City Guard are offering a hefty reward for capturing the culprits.  

I was hoping she would have simply given the information—even if only as a courtesy to me as their patron. Instead, she went behind my back and used Team 14 to retrieve that foolish book belonging to that idiot bard [Lysander]. She should let the past rest and move on. I have read that book, and the poems within are not even good. So why bother?  

Of course, the group accepted the objective…  

## Thieves’ Quarter
After a small reunion with assistant professor [Dannell], they learned about a tavern named Bubbles. (If Amber had been present, she would have known what this meant and urged them to stay far away from that individual.) Upon arriving in the Thieves’ Quarter, the group soon proved they had not lived in these streets. One thief can spot another thief with ease. From my understanding, they looked like tourists. It is fortunate they did not get mugged.  

After some asking around and day-drinking in a tavern (I worry about Caelum and the example he sets for poor little [Grof]), they followed a goblin into an alley with the promise of finding “Bubbles.” I do hope it was not a surprise to the group when they were ambushed. In front of them stood [Garent Millaneff], former guard of the Greyhawk Museum. [Rowan] tried to hide in the bar but was scolded for the ruckus outside and quickly left. Grof, meanwhile, had a big smile on his face.  

Garent was there for revenge. His face has not been the same since a certain orc of unknown height and skin colour bashed it in. An example set by a certain individual who soon will no longer be a part of Team 14. The former guard had hired half a dozen bandits to do his dirty work for him, while he immediately fled.  

In self-defense, Team 14 killed a few bandits, while two were eventually spared. One goblin archer on the roof managed to escape. #5 displayed wicked skills, managing to put two strong-looking fellows to sleep and making one goblin fall from the roof to his death. My intel also reported that during the fight a crab appeared and pinched a bandit to death. I strongly suspect this was a certain druid using his wild shape. Caelum even beheaded one of the bigger fighters. As impressive as this might sound, I must also note that he had earlier managed to miss the same man while he was asleep.  

## Bubbles
Soon the group discovered that the nameless tavern was not called Bubbles at all. Rather, this referred to its shady owner—Bubbles, a goblin revered among the thieves. Something Amber would certainly have told the others, had she been there. Normally, he would have demanded a hefty fee for any favours. Somehow, they managed to get intel without giving anything (although Rowan might claim he gave 10 gold). This worries me.  

Bubbles indirectly pointed the group to where they might find stolen goods.
