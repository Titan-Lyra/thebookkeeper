While reading my notes, I noticed some inconsistencies in the order of events. Some details might not even be truthful. I also assume I made mistakes while collecting information, as not everything seemed important at the time. Luckily, I have three wonderful assistants who help me access information so I don’t have to.

### Kasim did it!
Let’s start with the conclusion of our investigation. From the beginning, it was clear that [Kasim] did it. As my sidekick El, a.k.a. [Eleonora], rightfully asked: *what was his motive?* I already knew the how and the why, but what we needed was a confession out of the man himself.

[Ash], however, was more worried about the door that Lu, a.k.a. [Lucian], had kicked in. At that point, I realized the big guy had gone very quiet and would probably stay that way for a while, which was fine by me. He was with us in spirit.  

I convinced the imp to give us information. [Sath] appeared to be the boss of this small creature—nothing too surprising. I also told the imp that if anyone asked, he should say a Goliath Barbarian kicked in the door. Ash then suddenly realized he could just mend the door, so all my effort was for nothing in the end.

### Detective Derek solves the case
In front of a massive crowd, Kasim and his brother—whose name I completely forgot to write down—offered us a prize. Ash took it since I couldn’t care less about its contents. My prize was Kasim himself. The weasel tried to deny everything.  

I also discovered that I do not like smoking a pipe, which I borrowed from a gentleman.  

**Derek:**  
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to lay out the truth. The scratches we found? Not the claws of any stray dog, but the telltale marks of an imp.  

*[Gasps from the crowd.]*  

**Derek:**  
And where was that imp discovered? Not in the wilds… but caged in Kasim’s very office.  

**Kasim (snapping):** Lies! Mere coincidence!  

**Derek:**  
Coincidence, then, that you alone stood to profit should Ms. Suwan and Lamai’s rivalry flare into violence? With chaos, you would buy their stalls… expand your reach.  

*[The crowd begins murmuring louder.]*  

**Derek:**  
And still, one witness remains. [Lestur]. He saw you, Kasim, walking with a “pet.” Tell me—what man keeps an imp as a pet?  

*[Silence. Kasim pales.]*  

**Derek:**  
The evidence speaks. The creature was yours, the scheme was yours… and so too, the guilt is yours.  

*[The crowd erupts—half in outrage, half in vindication. Kasim stumbles back and admits everything.]*

#### The aftermath
At that point, I was more focused on the crowd. Kasim gave some excuse about his brother marrying a woman named Holly. I was even asked to perform songs at their wedding, which I reluctantly declined.  

Instead of sending Kasim to the gallows, I made sure he repaired all the damages he had caused. So hooray for me.  

*Edit:* I want to add that Lu was very helpful during the investigation. And okay… Ash and El too.

### The night at Tinker’s Row
[Lestur] approached us shortly after the big reveal. His sister [Jukura] had gone missing. He needed me and my assistants to solve that case as well. I didn’t think I’d gain much from it, but I also felt a bit bad for the dwarf since some people openly laughed at him during his earlier incident. So I agreed. The reward would be some scrolls and a book about magic (or something) for Ash. We also received a ticket to a presentation of some kind of invention. Lestur told us about it, but it didn’t seem important at the time.  

Ash insisted we get a drink. It had been a long time for me—drinking only reminded me of her. Still, I had a few from the bar lady [Rosie]. The night became a bit blurry after that, but I remember singing a song I probably shouldn’t have sung. At that point, I knew this was a mistake. Ash and El were having a conversation without me—or so I assume.  

The following morning, some guy was talking about the presentation we were already heading to anyway. He mentioned House Mahani Asani and Her Majesty the Queen. Apparently, they would appear at the event. Ash and El were reading the newspaper, which contained no information relevant to us. Who cares about Cambion employment at some store, or about Lestur missing a book on celestial divine divinations? If the latter was actually important, he would’ve asked us to find that book instead of his sister. At that point, I believed the dwarf was just very forgetful.

### At the Academy
Ash, being an alumnus of the Academy in the Noble District, gave us a small tour. There was a big crowd and people offering to show us the “real Bridge to Heaven.” I was curious enough to almost pay 1 gold to see what they were actually selling.  

El got harassed by some former priest since she was a cleric, so I hit him in the face and we all moved along.  

We entered the “High Society” gathering, where around 40 to 50 guests were present. The Harrington family was all there, including their adopted child [Jonathan Harrington].  

First we spoke with the inventor, [George Harrington], creator of the so-called “Bridge to Heaven.” He claimed his invention proved that the gods were jealous. We didn’t really care about that, but he told us that Jukura worked for his father, [Edmond Harrington]—the man who created the way to Avernus.  

Instead of going straight to Edmond, we first went to speak with beautiful Jonathan and his sister [Abigail Harrington]. They were fooling around with each other. The only thing we learned was that Jonathan wanted to be a writer and Abigail an artist.  

Edmond, standing with his assistant [Stella], told us our target had gone to Avernus 11 days ago on a supply run for Infernal Iron. Their contact in Avernus was the Cambion named [Gaby]. Since she was close friends with Jonathan, we went back to the beautiful man and asked him for more information. He said Jukura returned 8 days ago and gave the infernal alloy to George. After that, she went back to Avernus and hasn’t been seen since.  

So our next destination would be Avernus. However, Ash wanted to see the device, so we stayed a bit longer.

### The reveal
The reveal went as well as you’d expect. A golden angel suddenly appeared and scolded George. She said she had offered George and his family a place in the heavens if they would stop building the bridge.  

Interestingly, the device on display wasn’t the actual bridge. Although the angel seemed to have true sight, she didn’t know where the real bridge was. Things got very interesting, especially when she drew her sword—and then both she and George disappeared.
