If my memory serves me well, it was the sixth day of the week at the Demcan's Lock Markets in Lirrin's Reach. If you are not familiar with this place, you might think it was just an ordinary day like any other. However, every sixth day the markets stayed open longer. I remember this day clearly, as it was the day I met [Lou]({{ '/characters/lucian/' | relative_url }}). I even saw a [Taxabi]({{ '/characters/ash/' | relative_url }}) trying to be agile when he was blown back by an explosion. Somehow, he managed to keep hold of his bowl, though the contents spilled across the ground in front of him.

As with most nights recently, I had gone out into the streets for personal reasons I would rather not disclose. If anyone were to accuse me of deception, they would probably be right—though I would still deny it anyway.

### The explosion
*– Current suspects: the Taxabi stranger and/or the Tiefling Woman –*

The explosion came from a noodle stand owned by an elder gnome lady named [Lamai]. Shortly after, she got into an argument with a kobold. My notes at the time weren’t clear whether it was the younger [Kiev] or the elder [Suwan]. To be honest, I couldn’t care less—what mattered was that the commotion scared off the paying bystanders who had been listening to my music. I only earned ten gold that night, far less than I had expected. Unfortunately, I got dragged into the quarrel when a large paladin tried to intervene. It seemed interesting enough, so I decided to keep a close watch on the situation.
As the accusations flew back and forth, my instincts told me that neither the kobold nor the gnome were truly guilty. My eyes drifted toward the strange-looking Taxabi who had joined the fray. A wise observer like me always looks for other suspects—someone who lingers at the scene of a crime under the guise of being a mere bystander. That’s when I noticed a [Tiefling Woman]({{ '/characters/eleonora/' | relative_url }}), standing quietly, watching. She could have walked away, yet instead she remained, as if savoring the pain of her supposed victims.

Naturally, I took charge and declared that I would investigate the crime—for a handsome reward, of course. The Taxabi and the paladin were swept into my “team,” though I was already considering how to rid myself of them. Lou—the paladin’s name—offered to help for free, which meant I only had to find the right evidence to pin on the Taxabi, Ash. I suspect Ash knew I was onto him, because he invited the Tiefling woman to join our investigation. Unsurprisingly, they already knew each other, though they feigned surprise. Without evidence, I couldn’t accuse them outright—not yet. Later, Ash conveniently “discovered” scratch marks in the restaurant.

Lou seemed harmless enough, and easy to manipulate, so I kept him close to prevent Ash from swaying him. Yet Ash used mending to repair the noodle stand. That earned us free food, but I believe he also erased valuable evidence in the process. Meanwhile, I questioned Lamai. She openly blamed the kobolds and promised us one hundred gold for our service—though I suspected she’d later try to claim it was only eighty. She explained that her feud with the kobolds had gone on for years, starting with petty thefts of spices and other “innocent” slights. As I had expected, she seemed genuine. It was time to speak with the kobolds.
Not long after, a man named Kasim approached us. He urged us to abandon the investigation and instead join the market games that evening. To a skilled individual like myself, this was deeply suspicious. I told him yes—but of course, I had no intention of giving up the investigation.

*– Current suspects: the Taxabi stranger, the Tiefling Woman, and/or Kasim –*

Suwan later told us that Kiev and Lamai had been fighting with each other. Nothing new there. Still, she seemed sincere when she insisted that Kiev was not the culprit. She advised us to build a reputation by competing in the market games, which might earn us more information. She even promised us ten gold more than Lamai had offered. Meanwhile, Lou spoke with the younger kobold about his dream of traveling the world. The paladin even persuaded young Kiev to “just do it.” It was a fool’s plan, and I told them both so.

After the games I succesfully followed Ash who was following Kasim heading to his office. More on that later.

### The Market Games Part I: The Infernal Spices Challenge
To spread our chances, I decided to recruit the Taxabi and the Tiefling—who finally introduced herself as El, short for Eleonora. We began with the Infernal Spices, our first challenge. The rules were simple: pick a pepper and eat it. If you kept your composure, you moved on. Survive three rounds and you’d win, gaining one reputation point. Joining our table were a dwarven lady named Pepper and an elven man named Eldour. The hosts were Kasim and his brother—whose name, regrettably, I failed to note.

#### Round 1
El started and ate her pepper without issue. Ash grabbed one and didn’t even flinch. Pepper pretended to choose a spicy pepper, but it was obvious she was bluffing. I suspected Ash had done the same. Eldour wasn’t so lucky—he couldn’t handle it. Lou suffered the same fate, leaving in disgrace. The poor fellow looked up to me, so I couldn’t let him down. I chose a pepper, ate it swiftly, and of course, didn’t cheat. I promise.

#### Round 2
The remaining challengers all managed to pick peppers that seemed mild, though the dwarf might have gotten something hotter than before. By then, I knew I was being scammed. Somehow, the Taxabi and Tiefling had rigged the game in their favor. When my turn came, I decided to cheat—just once—but was immediately noticed by Kasim’s brother. Still, since I am an artist, my “performance” was convincing enough, and I was allowed to continue to the final round.

#### Round 3
I was now certain Ash and El were in league with each other, cheating their way to victory. I should have been proud, but they hadn’t shared their secret with me, which irked me. The dwarf failed in this round, leaving all eyes on me. The crowd held its breath as I carefully drew a pepper from the bag. To prove I wasn’t cheating, I locked eyes with the hosts and ate it. The burn hit me hard. If I were a true Dragonborn, it would have been nothing—but I endured. And I triumphed. The crowd erupted, cheering wildly. I saw both women and men cry at the sight of my epic victory. I had earned one reputation point (as did El and Ash).

After the game, I trailed Ash, who was following Kasim into his office. More on that later.

### The Market Games Part II: Madam Kuip and Her Worms
This wasn’t truly a game, but rather an odd job. Madam Kuip had lost her worms in the basement and needed us to retrieve them. For some reason, she added a timer to the task. Why? I don’t know. Did I care? Yes. Did I complain? No.

We split up in the dark basement to search. Lou lent me his sword—creatively named Sword—which glowed with light. As I rushed ahead, someone (not me) screamed as four giant wolf spiders appeared. I wanted to see how the others fared, so I let them engage first. I could have fought the spiders myself, of course, but my priority was returning Sword to Lou. The gentle paladin thought I needed saving and tried to grab me—unsuccessfully. I hurried back upstairs to warn Madam Kuip to stay put.

Ash proved himself a skilled fighter, wielding strange contraptions against the spiders. El wasn’t shabby either, and Lou fought with brute strength. I supported the team as needed. To my surprise, they worked well together—a team I might use again in future adventures.

Despite the effort, time ran out. I was the only one who recovered any worms (two, to be exact), so we failed the challenge.

As thanks, Madam Kuip gave us information. She hinted that someone was profiting from the conflict, and she personally believed both parties were innocent. Something I had already deduced, naturally. By now, I was almost certain that El and Ash were just random bystanders, and I struck them from my suspect list.

*– Current suspects: Kasim, and maybe his brother –*

### The Market Games Part III: The Flying Dwarf
Some might find the idea of a flying dwarf funny. I do not. This particular dwarf, Lestur, owned Consult the Tomes. He shouted at us to “grab the book.” Lou offered to throw me, but since I dislike being thrown, I suggested Ash instead. Surprisingly, the Taxabi agreed. Watching a Taxabi crash face-first into the dirt is hilarious. A refined reader such as yourself will understand the difference: a harmless dwarf flying is not funny; a Taxabi plummeting is. Humor is objective.

In any case, I managed to grab a few books, and one in particular caught my attention. I won’t share details—I still don’t know how I feel about what I read. After many failed attempts, El finally secured the correct scroll, causing the dwarf to fall. Again: not funny. Please don’t laugh. I said dwarf, not Taxabi.

There was some confusion about a scroll of binding or flying or something of that sort. As thanks, we received another reputation point. Lestur also directed us to Kasim’s office and mentioned a devil named [Sath]. So we went there at once.

### Kasim’s Office
I was on the verge of lockpicking the door when Lou burst through it, ruining my moment. I could have opened it with ease, of course, had the Taxabi not disturbed me. Instead, the door was left broken as we entered. Lou felt guilty, uneasy with the idea of breaking and entering.

Ash disguised himself as Sath—poorly. I chose to disguise myself as Sath’s wife, who I believe was named K.E. Please correct me if I misremembered.

Inside, we found an imp, who told us the “boss” was pleased.

*– Current suspects: Kasim, maybe his brother, and Sath? But who is the boss? –*
