Let us begin the adventure at the beginning. It was my first day at Strixhaven when I made the acquaintance of Caroline. She was a second year… no, I don’t believe that is a story I ought to document today. I would much rather speak of my fourth and final year at Strixhaven.

Allow me to warn you in advance: this account will be quite difficult to follow if you were not present yourself, so I shall do my utmost to record every detail I can summon to mind. However, dear reader, I must ask that you pay close attention to all particulars I have set down here.

## Visited by Augusta, the Dean of Order
If my memory serves me well, it was on a sunny mid-morning early in the semester when I was visited by one of my dear deans, [Augusta]. Her visit wasn’t quite a surprise, since every final-year student at Strixhaven receives a visit from one of their deans. In my case, it was the Dean of Order. She came into my dorm and informed me of my journey. To this day, I still deny the allegations that I successfully pickpocketed the dean to get my student card a tad bit earlier. Also note that yes, I would have been quite capable of doing so.

She explained that I was to work together with a group formed from students of the other colleges. I was pleased to hear that [Chronos] from Quandrix would be in my team. Somehow, that Harengon managed to enroll at Strixhaven directly in his final year. This was even approved by [Theoric Taiva]! That was quite a surprise when I discovered it. Thankfully, my unofficial request had been accepted.

[RyzeFoYu] was visited by both deans of Prismari—[Uvilda], Dean of Perfection, and [Nassari], Dean of Expression. [Ambrose], Dean of Shadow, visited [Malrix]. [Lisette], Dean of Root, visited [Devon]. And [Chronos] received a visit from [Kianne], Dean of Substance.

In hindsight, I should have asked this question immediately: Why us? Why was this particular group chosen? And yes, I know this is a Lorehold question. Were we chosen because it was our destiny (order), or was destiny created because we were chosen (chaos)?

## Rise Exilium

With haste, I went to the Archway Commons. The statue of Theoric Taiva, the Voice of the Founder, was towering before me. Above my head, a green icon hovered so I could easily identify my soon-to-be friends. Before we even managed to introduce ourselves, the man himself appeared before his own statue (well, he was hovering a bit off the ground). Theoric had a speech prepared in which he encouraged us to show the world that Strixhaven produces the greatest magicians in the world—or did he say continent?

After that, we had some time to get to know each other, and oh boy, I knew I would have a difficult job getting this team to work together. Within minutes, a fight broke out between Chronos and Malrix. I tried to hush the argument to no avail (allegedly, Malrix called Chronos a rabbit). Eventually, we received, by magical means, two instructions: “The Shady Spider Tavern” and “Madam Spider.” You don’t need to be a scholar to figure out those two were linked. Devon informed us it was a tavern just across the border of Witherbloom.

As you know, all teams need a proper name. We could not simply walk into a town and announce that we were five students from Strixhaven, followed by even more explanation. No, we needed something suitable. Using a name like Team 14 would have been amusing—however, I had already used that one before, or might use it later (I don’t know exactly which came first). People would inevitably ask what happened to the other teams. Fortunately, our long-eared friend came up with a wonderful suggestion: Exilium, which means…something.

This was the day Exilium was born. And onward we went to the Shady Spider Tavern.

## The Shady Spider Tavern
Upon arriving at the Shady Spider Tavern, we were greeted by [Madam Spider]. With her was another group (who clearly weren’t infighting, since they had arrived much earlier than we did). The group also consisted of five students from the different colleges. I was familiar with the Owlin [Javenesh Stoutclaw] from Lorehold. [Larine Arneza] was a human from Quandrix. [Melwythorne], the dryad from Witherbloom, blushed when he saw Devon (it is a strange thing to see—a dryad blushing). Another human, [Mina Lee], who seemed to be from Silverquill, was standing next to a human from Prismari with a difficult name. After some research, it turned out to be the boy named [Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III]; so after two people of that same name, they still decided to have a third one.

We entered the small tavern, which was run by the aforementioned Madam Spider. Her two grandchildren, [Kevin Lee] and [Sarah Lee] (no relation to Mina Lee), were working behind the bar. If I am not mistaken, Sarah was a second-year student from Witherbloom. We were served some delicacies from Witherbloom that aren’t for the faint of heart (although I have to admit, I never thought maggots could be tasteful).

We also received a candy from Madam Spider that would tell you your fortune in the form of a blurb. Yes, this is true—it would appear as an icon. For all the students in this group, it resulted in a red skull. I could tell there was panic behind the eyes of Madam Spider and her grandchildren. They were professional, though, and continued their tasks. The nameless group consisting of five students from Strixhaven (see, this is why all groups need names) left with the grandchildren while Madam Spider stayed with us.

Madam Spider tried to hand me an envelope when the attack happened.

## The Attack
Within seconds, two masked individuals entered the fray and began randomly setting the place ablaze. The envelope that was almost given to me burned to ash. As the bard of the group, I tried to reason with the attackers while there was commotion outside, but soon enough, I realized there was no way to negotiate with them. So everything we did afterward was in self-defense.

I won’t take the full credit for the victory in this fight. I had a big role in it nonetheless, but as any leader would say, it is those who are led who should get some credit to keep them happy. The most important things I remember are that RyzeFoYu managed to stumble against the door, which resulted in it blocking the way in and out (he seemed oddly friendly to one of the attackers halfway through the fight). I even tried to reason with one of them, which resulted in me nearly dying. Unfortunately, both attackers perished against us—but not before uttering the words:

> “The sixth dragon is coming.”

## Epilogue
Since we didn’t know what those words meant, we had no choice but to improvise. There was still a commotion outside. This was the first time I had to reveal to my party that I was no Dragonborn, but a Changeling. I took the clothes of the captain of the two attackers (we had figured out they both held high rank) and transformed into the dead attacker—though appearing as if he were still alive.

The thrilling part is that I had no idea who this person was that I was impersonating, or who might be waiting for me outside.
