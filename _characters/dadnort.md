Dadnort is a talkative gnome whom Team 14 encountered during their heist at the Greyhawk Museum. At their first meeting, they ended up in conversation with him for a remarkable two and a half hours. Whether or not he mentioned his pregnant wife during this exchange remains unclear. I can only assume he didâ€”after all, they went so far as to propose having dinner with him, and by extension, with her.
