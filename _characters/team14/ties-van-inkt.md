Don’t be misled by my reaction to this boy. Yes, he is rather needy, but that isn’t what concerns me. I first met him in the Greyhawk Library while I was researching accounts of past events. He tried to explain why the War of the Five Brothers was among the greatest conflicts the continent had ever seen. He wasn’t entirely wrong, but the details of that war have become distorted over the years.

To begin with, there were actually only four brothers; Prince Niren was their nephew—though, admittedly, “The War of the Four Brothers and One Nephew” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it. And it was hardly a true war: there was one large battle, followed by a long stalemate, and finally another clash with no decisive victor. A curious note: Nyrond was eventually founded by one of Prince Niren’s descendants. But I digress.

Ties is a kind boy, almost always with a book in his hand—or his face buried in it. Ever since I introduced myself, he has been visiting me regularly. It’s troubling how much knowledge he is determined to acquire. Someone driven by malice is easier to anticipate—knowledge can be a blunt weapon in such hands. But someone who hungers for understanding as fervently as Ties van Inkt is bound to become ever more curious. Sooner or later, when I can no longer satisfy his questions, he will seek out a greater source of wisdom.

He reminds me of myself.
