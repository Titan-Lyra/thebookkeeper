Before I start writing, I have to take a deep breath. Sometimes it is better to wait before you act, but if you wait too long, people will get hurt. Doing something is always better than doing nothing. Although some will claim that taking destiny in your own hand might make things worse. This was also the night that [Chronos] had a nightmare. He claimed that this truly happened, although at the time that seemed really unlikely. Why would [Kianne] threaten her prized student? Although it would be very funny (and slightly worrisome) if true.

## Waking up in the Shady Spider Tavern
We woke up in the Shady Spider Tavern to be greeted by the deans of Witherbloom, [Lisette] and [Valentin]. I still remember the smell of roses. We were praised for our heroism. They told us about the coordinated attacks within Strixhaven by the Oriq. Our group was one of the few that managed to withstand the attack. We even took notice of [Tedric], the voice of the founders himself. At that point I was eager to meet him.

After some tasty breakfast from [RyzeFoYu] (which wasn’t as good as usual) we decided to be escorted by a large group of battle mages to Tedric’s tower. I would later find out that [Malrix] had some ambition to become a cook. It is my belief that he would have tried to spice the food, which would degrade the end result.

## Tedric’s Tower
Arriving in the center of Strixhaven, we were standing before Tedric’s tower—his main office, you might say. The tower was being guarded by some stronger-looking battle mages. After arriving we had to wait for a moment before we were called. During this time I played a song for [Devon] to inspire her.

As the de facto leader I walked in front through some alarm portals. I didn’t know they were alarm portals at the time. Oddly enough, the only items we had to leave at the portal were any magical items. Notably, the only magic items we had on us were those we took from the Oriq. My daggers were perfectly fine to bring into the room.

The room was large, with in the center a grand white table with, if I counted correctly, 20 chairs. It was impressive. Tedric was standing in front of a plateau with a glass dome (or ball). I had never seen anything like it. Once he took notice of us, he asked us to take a seat—with me sitting directly next to him, and on the other end of the table our tiefling friend Malrix.

Chronos originally didn’t want to enter the tower at all. After some arguing he decided to join us. He didn’t speak a word during this meeting. I do think this is a good thing, and I do hope he has more nightmares from now on. He is so much easier to deal with when he is like this.

Tedric seemed oddly calm after everything that transpired earlier. I would have assumed that the voice of the founders would have called us to help with the battle. Sadly, he chose to go on the defense—a strategy that won’t work. He even decided that we could already do the Trials in the Biblioplex the next day. My only logical assumption would be that he is trying to get rid of us. There could be no other motives. When I told him about the sixth dragon he just scoffed, like it was no big deal at all. This guy had no urgency at all for what was happening under his nose.

I tried to plead with him to let me go undercover. There was nothing to lose. I could infiltrate the organisation from within and send information back to him directly. Still, he said I had to do the trials. When I said that I would do it after the trial, his answer was a stern “no.”

Worst of all, he secretly and without permission took all our clothes. And yes, I am aware that there is a rule that faculty members can take illegal items without permission. But he didn’t ask. To silence us he gave us amulets of lesser fire resistance to soften the theft. But it shouldn’t be a surprise that a voice won’t listen to reason.

My group decided to do the trials. They accepted the orders from sir Tarva. I didn’t. That night I tried to gather information, unsuccessfully. The only thing I managed to create was a fight between two battle mages. Nothing more. So I earned my stay in a nearby tavern by playing some music, although halfway through the night I blacked out.

## Escort to the Biblioplex
The very next day we were escorted to the Biblioplex where we were greeted by the friendly librarian [Bellatrix] and [Codie], Vociferous Codex, a flying book. At that point I wasn’t paying much attention since I had other things on my mind. I remember seeing pictures being drawn in that flying book, which seemed to be a registration of some sort. Let’s finish this quickly so I can go back to things that truly matter. Saving Strixhaven.
