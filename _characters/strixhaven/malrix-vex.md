Malrix Vex is a brash Thiefling Warlock. He thinks he is a smooth talker, which is expected from someone from Silverquill. He was my first true nemesis in this lifetime. Or perhaps I was his. Although, to be fair, I don’t think he ever realized it was me.

He was the illustrious inventor of the Doom Coin™—a name that sounds impressive but is, in reality, just an elaborate pyramid scheme (my lawyers insist I say “allegedly”). For quite some time, I disguised myself as various Strixhaven faculty members to skim a few coins from him here and there. Most of the time, he didn’t fall for it. But there was that one occasion when I managed to extract ten gold and donate it to the Mage Tower fund. In his name of course.

Rumour has it he forged his way into Strixhaven (legal disclaimer inserted by my lawyers: this is hearsay and has not been substantiated).

After I managed to get a hold of his book (which proved there is indeed something peculiar about his Doom Coin™), I was able to identify that he might be collecting (parts of) souls for his patron.
