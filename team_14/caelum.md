title: Caelum, Son of Dustan I of Nyrond
---

**Species:** Human  
**Class:** Fighter  

From my own intel, I understand that Caelum was trained for the battlefield. Presumably, his dream is to become Lord Commander one day. He has accepted that he shall never be a king. That has been reserved for his older brother. In my honest opinion, Caelum is the lucky one. Most king's are fools and only a fool wants to be a king.

There was a time when it was believed that he had perished in the wilderness. Nevertheless, I met him on the 16th of Ches, 1493DR. He tried to hide it, but he carries a purple glowing stone with him. Normally, I would not waste my time on trinkets, but something tells me there is more to this stone than meets the eye.
