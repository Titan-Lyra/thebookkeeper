I don’t often praise myself, but today I will. Team 14 has at last become a true team—one bound by trust. It took them some time, and that’s on them. Without me, this collection of strangers would never have found their path to greatness. Still, I am disappointed that [Rose] chose to act behind my back.

## A Rude Awakening
I kept my composure when I entered the slums and found [a prince]({{ '/characters/caelum/' | relative_url }}) sprawled across a filthy mattress. One light kick was enough to wake him. They had hired a man named [Bronn] to escort them in confronting the true thieves of the museum. Afterwards, they disposed of several bodies in the nearby river—polluting the waters of the Free City of Greyhawk. I still wonder how they managed to move six corpses so efficiently. With [Rowan] injured, he slipped away to seek aid.

I told them they were finished. Rose should never have asked for their help. As #0, she was meant to operate in the shadows as part of the team, not outside of it. She was there when they entered the museum, and she was even spotted in the Sage’s Quill that night by [Amber]. Fortunately, she had her hood pulled low.
I told them they were done—but as an observer, I knew there was always a chance they would defy me. A small part of me even hoped they would. But not this time. When Rose left only a minute after I did, she may have pleaded with them to aid her. Perhaps she even shared my thoughts about them. I won’t confirm it, nor will I deny it. Knowing Rose, she may have simply told them the truth.

## The Stolen Goods
There was no deception in [Bubbles]’ words—the stolen goods were exactly where he claimed they would be. Amber was understandably unsettled that such information came to them without a price, though that is a tale for another time. I believe it was [Grof] who suggested that the mercenary Bronn lure former museum guard [Garent Millaneff] into an alley so they could deal with him quietly. Instead, Bronn struck Garent and vanished with the coin.

Inside, they discovered the book of [Lysander], which immediately caught [Alice]’s attention. She leafed through its endless laments—an unbroken stream of complaints, verses to supposed lovers (though I doubt there were many), and more of the same. Yet three particular poems drew her notice.

### The Book of Lysander

> **The Accursed Kingdom**
>
>The night was torn open by steel,
>and fire swallowed the fields we knew.
>She fell where the shadows thickened,
>her hand still reaching for mine—
>but the smoke took her voice,
>and the earth took her eyes.
>
>I carried only our daughter,
>her breath small as a candle,
>her tears hot against my chest.
>Behind us, the sky cracked red,
>and the songs of our kin
>were ground into silence.
>
>Now the road is our only shelter,
>the past a wound that will not close.
>She walks with me, one step at a time,
>and I tell her stories so she can sleep—
>but my heart is stone,
>and my words are knives.
>
>May the winds never soften their banners,
>may their throne splinter to dust.
>For all I have lost,
>for all they have taken,
>
>I curse Nyrond.
>

> **The Bastard**
>
> They hid him in the hush of night,
> a child born of shadow and shame.
> No cradle of gold,
> no blessing of kings,
> only the whisper of blood unspoken.
>
> His mother wept in silence,
> his father turned his gaze away.
> Yet the veins of Nyrond
> flowed fire through his heart,
> and the crown, though denied,
> burned in his dreams.
>
> He will rise when the kingdom falters,
> when banners are torn by the wind.
> From dust he shall gather his throne,
> from ruin he shall forge his name.
> The bastard no longer forgotten,
> the orphan no longer denied.
>
> The crown will not escape him,
> for fate bends to his step.
> And when he sits upon their seat of stone,
> the kingdom that scorned him
> shall kneel to the son they cast aside.
>
> The bastard prince is promised.
> And Nyrond shall be his.
>

> **Rose**
> 
> Forgive me, child of my blood,
> blossom torn from the garden of fire.
> I held you through nights of ash,
> sang you the songs your mother left,
> and swore the world would not take you.
>
> But my heart has grown black with grief,
> a stone that cannot shelter you.
> The blade I carry is sharper than love,
> the path I walk devours the light.
> What future could I build with ruin in my hands?
>
> So I gave you to another,
> a wanderer who carries stories
> instead of swords.
> His book will keep you safer
> than my shadow ever could.
> His voice will weave you dreams,
> where mine only mutters curses.
>
> You will not know the weight I bear,
> nor the graves that follow my steps.
> But if you hear the wind in the leaves,
> know it is me—watching,
> wishing I had been strong enough to stay.
>
> Rose, my Rose,
> forgive your father.

After speaking with [Alda Arkin], she admitted she had given the book to them willingly. Despite her efforts, the city guard still placed their trust in me when I assured them my team had no part in any unauthorized theft. Still, the former curator insisted that they had taken certain goods with them. Both Alda and Garent were sent to Revel’s End, the fortress where they will remain for a long time. Hopefully, no one will find a reason to seek them there.

The book never reached Rose. I believe they recognized the same danger I did—that its words could bring nothing but harm.

## Kashmir
The meeting with [Kashmir] seemed almost entertaining—though ultimately fruitless. From what I gather, Amber left the encounter rather shaken. Kashmir himself is harmless (for now), no more than a delusional cult leader. He presides over the House of the Last, proclaiming himself “The Last God.” As long as the true gods do not intervene, I feel little cause for concern. Perhaps I will form a new team to keep watch over him. The only useful detail uncovered was that he had been the one to sell the potion to the lord of Streaming Springs.
For anyone drawn to join his cult, there are but five commandments to remember:

1. Every child of the Last must remain naked, as they were born.
2. The Last is the only god you may worship—for all others are destined to die.
3. No one may question the Last or his wisdom.
4. He who speaks ill of the Last shall still be saved; if evil has taken root in the heart, then all is permissible.
5. Those who truly believe in the Last shall never know death. Only those with evil in their hearts can die.

## The Next Journey
There was much debate over whether they should travel to Nyrond, but in the end, they chose to go, but by themselves. Alice entered the Sage’s Quill under a finely wrought illusion to give this message. It took me only five seconds to pierce the disguise, though her beloved [Caleb] needed far longer to recognize her. Perhaps love truly is blind. Caleb, wisely, chose to hold her hostage until Caelum revealed himself.

What none of us knew was that Caelum was already succumbing to illness. At first, they suspected the tea—he alone had drunk at the House of the Last. Yet somehow he managed to reach the tavern before collapsing. Beside him, a tiny Amethyst Dragon curled up to sleep—the egg he had carried now hatched. While Team 14 prepared to depart, with Rowan once again among them, Caelum remained lost in slumber.

So ends the tale of Team 14—for now. Their story will continue eastward, in a kingdom under shadow. The prince will return home. And if you read these words in the far future, you'll already know this: the tale ahead will not be a happy one. A dark cloud gathers over Nyrond.
