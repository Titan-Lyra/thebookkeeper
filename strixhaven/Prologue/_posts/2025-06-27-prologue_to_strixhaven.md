I can’t remember why I chose to enroll in Strixhaven. Was it the allure of magic, the gathering of so many people in one place, or was it something else entirely? Lately, I’ve been thinking back to that time, which feels like a lifetime ago. I remember writing everything down back then. I hope to recover every single note of my youth, including this one—though I fear they are lost in the void. For now, I will write down everything I can recall.

## Strixhaven

Beautiful, beautiful Strixhaven, nestled in the land of Arcavios. As a lad from Lorehold, I wasn’t exactly meant to wander into the other colleges’ territories. But as a student of lore and history, how could I let such boundaries keep me from exploring the grandeur of the wider campus? Still, more often than not, you'd find me back on the Lorehold grounds—home base, after all.

### The five colleges
If you create a magic school, you need houses. Or rather—colleges. Each college was founded by a dragon, whose name it proudly bears. It’s really quite simple. And before I forget, I’ve taken the liberty of noting the deans and each college’s mascot. The dragons themselves haven’t been seen for ages, by the way.

#### Witherbloom
Let me warn you: stay out of Witherbloom if you don’t belong there. Or better yet—just stay out altogether. A college devoted entirely to life and death is the sort of thing that intrigues me, so naturally, I won’t heed my own warning. Still, I’ve got the distinct impression that they experiment with those forces rather more enthusiastically than most would find comfortable. Then again, I once met a cleric who would have fit into Witherbloom perfectly. So—ignore everything I just wrote.

**Founding Dragon:** Beledros Witherbloom

**Deans:** Valentin, Dein of the Vein & Lisette, Dein of the Root.

**Mascot:** a Pest

**Colours:** Black & Green

#### Quandrix

I have studied mathematics before—perhaps not in this lifetime, but that doesn’t mean I’m bad at it. Please refrain from spreading this malicious slander. Students from the College of Quandrix are quite obsessed with math. And by that, I mean they literally shape their magic around it.

**Founding Dragon:** Tanazir Quandrix

**Deans:** Kianne, Dean of Substance & Imbraham, Dean of Theory

**Mascot:** a Fractal for Quandrix

**Colours:** Green & Blue

#### Prismari

As far as I can recall, they seem like a colourful bunch—mostly focused on their feelings, which, in my honest opinion, is something more people ought to do. Every good story needs feelings; without them, it’s nothing but a dull record of facts (or fiction). This has absolutely nothing to do with the College of Prismari, but hopefully you’ve learned a wonderful lesson nonetheless.

**Founding Dragon:** Galazeth Prismari

**Deans:** Uvilda, Dean of Perfection & Nassari, Dean of Expression

**Mascot:** an Art Elemental

**Colours:** Blue & Red

#### Silverquill
If you haven’t noticed by now, I’m someone who loves to wield words to my advantage. I’ve even debated both deans of the College of Silverquill on the power of language. And before you ask—yes, I could have joined that college and indulged my passion to my heart’s content. But for me, there was something even more important than words.

**Founding Dragon:** Shadrix Silverquill

**Deans:** Shaile, Dean of Radiance & Embrose, Dean of Shadow

**Mascot:** an Inkling

**Colours:** Black & White

#### Lorehold
As a recorder of stories, I’ve often wondered about the meaning behind it all. A war hero saves his kingdom, only to watch that same kingdom crumble within a century. Viewed through the lens of order, it seems like a carefully woven pattern—every action unfolding precisely at the right moment. But then again, I was killed by a pack of wolves after setting out to save the realm from a cosmic evil. Was that fate planned too? And if so, to what end? These questions are why I joined the College of Lorehold: to explore the delicate balance between order and chaos.

**Founding Dragon:** Velomachus Lorehold

**Deans:** Plargg, Dean of Chaos & Augusta, Dean of Order

**Mascot:** a Spirit Statue

**Colours:** White & Red

### Mage Tower
As your favorite Mage Tower commentator—the intense team sport beloved by some Strixhaven students—I know all there is to know. Let me see if I can recall the rules... But before I do, let me tell you about the Oriq, or I might just forget!

### The Oriq
A secret organization we always suspected was just a rumour — but turns out, they actually exist. And we should be careful. How is this not a trap for me? After rereading this, I’m eager to figure it all out again. Who are they? What do they want? One thing’s certain: there’s an adventure waiting.

## The Cast

As it was planned all along, our ragtag group came together—five members spanning the different colleges. If you’ve been following my records for any length of time, you’ll know (or eventually realize) that I don’t believe in coincidences. I’m a believer in fate. Though, I also suspect fate can be nudged in a certain direction when needed. So whether this was chaotic fate or a carefully laid plan, I can’t say. But this group was perfect.

That said, it would have been rather entertaining to have a Bugbear Fighter as a bodyguard. Not that I disliked this lot—but a bugbear would have been great.

### Devon – Witherbloom
The first thing (or rather, the first person) I recall is [Devon von Something]({{ '/characters/devon-von-durchdenwald/' | relative_url }}). I’ll have to update my notes when her full name comes back to me. Good old Devon, with her endless shenanigans… although, now that I think about it, I might be confusing her with someone else of a similar name.

Wasn’t she the one with the pet bird—or was it some sort of spirit animal—that she almost never bothered to use? Or wait, am I mixing her up with a male Goliath again? In any case, Devon was definitely the one who had certain… issues with her younger brother. The same brother she ended up killing with some particularly dangerous magic.

### Chronos – Quandrix
Let the record show that [Chronos]({{ '/characters/chronos/' | relative_url }}) is not a rabbit—he’s a Harengon. I’ll forgive you if you’ve made that mistake, but please keep it in mind.

What can I say about this particular figure? Tall ears—if I recall, about seven inches (or was it centimeters?). A wizard dabbling in cleric arts. 

Not much else to say—except that somehow he got sent back in time and landed right in Strixhaven. Or maybe it was forward? Honestly, keeping track of him is a full-time job. At least I’m not the only one with a delightfully tangled, self-centered backstory.

### RyzeFoYu – Prismari
“Every group needs a [RyzeFoYu]({{ '/characters/ryzefoyu/' | relative_url }}).” Not my words, but those of a somewhat skilled monk I once worked alongside. As I sit here writing this, I can’t recall much else about him—though I’m sure more details will return eventually.

### Malrix Vex – Silverquill
[Malrix Vex]({{ '/characters/malrix-vex/' | relative_url }}) was my first true nemesis in this lifetime. Or perhaps I was his. Although, to be fair, I don’t think he ever realized it was me.

He was the illustrious inventor of the Doom Coin™—a name that sounds impressive but is, in reality, just an elaborate pyramid scheme (my lawyers insist I say “allegedly”). For quite some time, I disguised myself as various Strixhaven faculty members to skim a few coins from him here and there. Most of the time, he didn’t fall for it. But there was that one occasion when I managed to extract ten gold and donate it to the Mage Tower fund. In his name of course.

Rumour has it he forged his way into Strixhaven (legal disclaimer inserted by my lawyers: this is hearsay and has not been substantiated).

### Derek – Lorehold
Every story has a main character—and in this story, that would be [me]({{ '/characters/derek/' | relative_url }}). I was the brains of the group. And the muscle (in the Dragonborn form I borrowed). And, of course, the wit.

I had it all. As you’ll see throughout these accounts, I was the binding force that held this group together. My skills were unmatched. And, conveniently, as far as I know, I’m the only one who bothered to record our time at Strixhaven in detail.
