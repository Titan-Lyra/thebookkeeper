I can’t remember why I chose to enroll in Strixhaven. Was it the allure of magic, the gathering of so many people in one place, or was it something else entirely? Lately, I’ve been thinking back to that time, which feels like a lifetime ago. I remember writing everything down back then. I hope to recover every single note of my youth, including this one—though I fear they are lost in the void. For now, I will write down everything I can recall.

The first thing (or rather, the first person) I recall is [Devon von Something]({{ '/characters/devon-von-durchdenwald/' | relative_url }}). I’ll have to update my notes once I finally remember his full name. Good old Devon and his endless shenanigans… although now that I think about it, I might be confusing him with someone else of a similar name. Wasn’t Devon the one with the pet bird—or was it a spirit animal—that he almost never used? Oh, wait. Now I’m mixing him up with a Goliath.
