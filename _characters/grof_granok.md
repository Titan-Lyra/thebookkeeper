Grof Gra’nok is an orc barbarian who enjoys smashing things. From what I’ve observed, he rarely uses words longer than two syllables (note: I still need to find out which tribe he comes from). His light red skin is particularly striking, quite unlike the usual orcish green. When asked about it, he refused to explain. Sooner or later, the others will discover the truth—assuming they survive long enough to do so.
