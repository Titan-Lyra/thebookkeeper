"Dr. Cassee Dannell is a brilliant academic, long ago learned to hide her interest in the occult. By age twenty-four. Dr. Dannell has earned her doctorate in anthropology from Varkenbluff University, a prestigious instituation in her home city. Here ability to connect local archaelogical objects with their cultural context was unrivaled, so after her graduation, Dr. Dannell became a Varkenbluff faculty member and field scientis, accompanying the university' archaeology crews on digs in the area." (Needs verification) 

Clever, but during our first meeting she turned out to be quite frightened. Once I managed to calm her down, she explained her profession to me. For a moment, she seemed convinced I was somehow aligned with [Alda Arkin](../alda-arkin), the museum curator. As I told her—and as I would say to anyone who questions my motives—I do not pick sides. And, as always, every meeting remains strictly confidential. That doesn’t mean I won’t record a few details for my own archive.
