I am not one for making assumptions, but I do suspect that Lysander hates my guts. Perhaps I shouldn’t have used his identity—an indiscretion that landed him with that debt at the Moonglow Inn. Or maybe he despises me simply because I am a better performer, though he would deny it to his last breath.
The truth is, I do not trust Lysander. I don’t believe he harbors evil intentions, but if he possessed my particular talents, he would surely have put them to use for his own selfish ends.
If you ever encounter him, he will act warm and gracious, but take care, dear reader: behind the charm, his intentions are rarely pure. He might pick your pocket even as he lavishes you with compliments.
To be fair, he has accomplished good deeds as well. Unfortunately, I have yet to uncover what he gained from them—besides his supposed death.
