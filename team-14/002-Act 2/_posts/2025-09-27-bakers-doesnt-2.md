## Redaction
It has come to my attention that both [Alice] and [Rowan] survived—but in a candified state. My previous log erroneously reported their deaths. They did not perish.

## How Caelum Unfortunate-ly Returned
Apparently, he managed to slip away while everyone assumed he was asleep. I had hoped he wouldn’t find the party (for their own safety), but here we are. [Fill Flourforge] informed him that the golden draken the party sought was his. The dragon is named [Briochebane], though Caelum, of course, insisted on calling it “Frank de Vries.” One can only hope that his dragon, [Amithar], keeps him in check as he grows older, for some of his decisions during this mission were… questionable.

## What Went Wrong
I will admit that I am not without fault. Mistakes were made. Though some blame may lie with the prince as well.

1. In urgent need of [Amber] and her team for another mission, I entrusted a letter to Fill, who waited outside. I assumed he would remain outside and that the party would not return until later. This was a miscalculation: Caelum stepped outside just after I handed over the letter. Had he left even a minute earlier, I would have been discovered. The contents caused distress to the rogue, as I expected. Were I to do it again, I would word the message differently.

2. I knew that the hag [Uncle Nibblecheek] could be deadly if Team 14 were careless. I intended for them to regroup outside and strategize how to uncharm the golden dragon wyrmling. Instead, they followed him downstairs into his domain.

## What Happened
From the party’s perspective, it was a slaughter. They were outmatched; poor [Grof] bore the full fury of the hag. Alone, the hag would have been formidable. Add the dragon and four gingerbread people… and their demise would have been certain. Fortunately, [Uncle Nibblecheek] preferred to turn them into chocolate rather than annihilate them outright. This delay gave the heroic Rowan time to escape and single-handedly defeat the hag—or at least, that is what the party believes. They must trust him for now.

## And Afterwards
The entire party, including the squirrel [Nibbles], traveled north to Leukish under my instructions. Their cozy lives are about to change forever, as the fate of the world may rest in their hands. No pressure.
I believe Fill returned [Asger Applegarth] to Hubbleton. The Nyrond soldiers likely left to search for their lost prince once more. [Caleb] will have to confront his father.

I failed. I failed again and again. I wished Team 14 would be the one. I've made a huge mistake. My end draws near.
