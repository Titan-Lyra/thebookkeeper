Oh wow... credit given where credit is due. Team 14 is proving to be more reliable than I expected. The citizens of Greyhawk can thank their gods that I have formed this team. And that to think I almost recuited some different members. Although I think a wizard or sorcerer would have been fitting for this group. That doesn't mean that this team isn't adequit. I think I will use the word "splendid" for them.

### Meeting with Doctor Dannell
At my request, they made their way to the University of Greyhawk to meet with [Doctor Dannell]({{ '/characters/doctor-dannell/' | relative_url }}). However, it turned out the Doctor had been dismissed from her position. During their conversation, she explained to Team 14 that the Murkmire Stone is, in fact, the egg of an Eldritch Horror—and worse still, the egg is nearly ready to hatch. She handed over her bag of holding, which [#2]({{ '/characters/amber/' | relative_url }}) took into her care. Inside the bag, they found formal attire for the gala, along with tickets for the event.

One detail struck me as peculiar: she offered them only 100 gold. I would have expected her to pay far more for a task of this magnitude—especially considering retrieving the egg could help her regain her position at the university. Still, I’m glad to see Team 14 is at least receiving some compensation.

### A Trip through the Museum
They got off to a rocky start. Posing as a group of tourists, they entered the museum—and apparently triggered an alarm in the process. That’s certainly one way to discover the east doors are rigged with alarms. Not long after, the rogue nearly got herself caught trying to pickpocket a guard. When [redacted] relayed this part to me, I was almost ready to send in backup. Somehow, they managed to de-escalate the situation. I still don’t understand this note: “The orc got bored watching the plants.”

Eventually, they pulled themselves together and made it upstairs—hardly the most difficult part of the job, but at that point, I’ll take any small victory. [#1]({{ '/characters/caelum/' | relative_url }}) still carries that distinctive noble air about him (and as a fellow noble, I feel entitled to say so). I do wonder whether most of the people he spoke to thought he was completely unhinged. I almost wish he were more like [#4]({{ '/characters/grof-granok/' | relative_url }}), who at least has the sense to keep quiet unless he has something worthwhile to say. Even so, #1 managed to glean a few useful details about the museum from [Dadnort], the gnome who runs the Unearthed Café. Why does my report say they spoke with the gnome for two and a half hours?

After another run-in with a guard, they finally slipped into a locked room—only to be discovered by yet another guard. Fortunately, it was Violet Pendergilt. (As a side note, she might make an excellent pairing with [#5]({{ '/characters/alice/' | relative_url }}) for my next gathering.). And yes, you read that correctly: they managed to talk their way out of the situation by claiming they were looking for the privy. They were extremely lucky Violet was the one who found them rather than Garent, who would have bullied them into paying a tidy sum for their trouble.

Later, at the Sage’s Quill, they regrouped to plan for the gala. I do wish I could have seen the orc dressed in formal attire.

### The Gala
This is the part where, in my opinion, the team was at their best. [#3]({{ '/characters/rowan/' | relative_url }}) was fascinated by the Murkmire Stone—or so I’ve been told. Hopefully, he discovered, like [redacted], the secret and rather elaborate defense mechanism. If he took the time to study the stone, I have no doubt he pieced it together.

My notes also mention that, during the gala, the rogue and the bard slipped away under the pretense of visiting the privy. Upon closer inspection, it turned out they were sneaking up to the attic. There, they discovered the skylight they would later use as a hiding place. Why all five of them didn’t end up there remains a mystery to me. Both of them managed to return unnoticed—at least, as far as I am aware.

Before all of that, the noble fighter managed to convince the curator, [Alda Arkin]({{ '/characters/alda-arkin/' | relative_url }}), to meet with him privately in her office. He used his own stone as the perfect conversation piece. Naturally, the rogue accompanied him. Since everything after that took place behind closed doors, I have no firsthand account of what transpired. So here is my own reconstruction of the exchange:

---

#1: Look at my shiny stone.

Alda: Oh, how wonderful. I’ll give you two gold.

#1: Is that enough?

#2: No, Caelum, that is not enough…

#1: Ok! (makes his ridiculous thinking face) Three gold!

#2: Excuse us—his stone is not for sale.

Alda: Pity. Lucky for him such a clever girl came along.

---

This is, of course, based solely on the facts: #1 left the room still carrying his stone, #2 looked quite satisfied with herself, and Alda—well, she’s Alda. I have nothing further to add about her demeanor.

Before I forget, the rogue managed to slip a card out of Alda’s purse. I suspect this is the very card I’ve heard whispers about. So far, so good.

At the time of writing, three of them are hiding on the roof, while #1 and #4 have slipped outside. I’m tempted to visit the museum myself to watch the action unfold—though not from too close a vantage.

### Things to add to my to-do list:
- Have a talk with [redacted] about why she was spotted.
- Arrange a meeting with the Lady of Streaming Springs.
